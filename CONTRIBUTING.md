## Install the Latest Version of GEX

To install the latest version from GitHub, execute the following command in your terminal:

`go get -u github.com/ignite/gex`

Then run the code with executing gex in the terminal:

`gex`

## Code structure

Currently the code resides in the `main.go` file. Additionally, there is an example how-to-connect-with-websocket file in `websocket.go`, which shows how the websocket connection is created to Cosmos SDK.

Websocket takes care of the blocks, transactions and validators feed. A combination of the websocket and API requests are used in order to also feature connected peers or the version of Cosmos SDK currently running.

The UI framework used for the terminal is [Termdash](https://github.com/mum4k/termdash). Visit the GitHub page to get inspiration on what is possible to do with Termdash, how to work with it, or which charting styles and paginations are available.
